how to get images to float left so they are aligned and made smaller on smaller view sizes? If I float the row left and float none the next row, still screws up layout



gemNumber function (x) I pass through an x and then return to it ....What is the difference between that and CompGuess with no x in ()?

$(document).ready(function () why this is staying white?
